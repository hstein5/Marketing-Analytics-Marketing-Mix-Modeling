# Marketing-Analytics-Marketing-Mix-Modeling

## Background
Pernalonga, a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand products in over 400 categories.  Pernalonga regularly partners with suppliers to fund promotions and derives about 30% of its sales on promotions.  Until recent experimentation with personalized promotions, most of Pernalonga’s promotions are chain-wide promotions. 

The beer category is promoted regularly in Pernalonga’s stores.  Mahou San Miguel, a Spanish brewer, sells three San Miguel beer products in Pernalonga’s stores and regularly partners with Pernalonga to promote its products via weekly flyers and in-store displays.  Mahou San Miguel also employs other marketing vehicles such as email, web (display banners and paid search), and traditional media (TV and Radio).

## Problem
Your analytics consulting firm was selected by Mahou San Miguel (the client) to verify the effectiveness of its promotions and marketing partnership with Pernalonga.  The client is interested in identifying promotion and marketing activities that drive significant incremental sales for continuation into 2020.  The timing is perfect, your Data Science team recently concluded a recommender systems project and a pricing project with Pernalonga, so you are well-versed with Pernalonga’s data.  

Your Data Science team with its experience in marketing mix modeling in the Lunitunia market also have the following insights:
- Seasonality of the Beer category
- National holidays in Lunitunia in 2016 and 2017
- TV advertisements have an 8-week half-life, and GRPs map into target audience 2+ Reach via the following formula: 
    Reach = 0.95(1 − e^(− 0.020 GRP))
- Radio advertisements have a 4-week half-life, and GRPs map into target audience 2+ Reach via the following formula
    Reach = 0.90(1 − e^(− 0.025 GRP))

With the above insights and supplemental transaction and product data from Pernalonga, you are ready to demonstrate your capabilities in marketing analytics and help the client identify promotion and marketing vehicles that drive significant results.
